# Camera-Callibration
Camera Calibration Using Tsai's Method

This repository contains the implementation of Tsai's method for camera calibration, demonstrated on a Logitech C270 webcam. The project aims to precisely map the 3D objects to their 2D image representations, addressing linear projection complexities and optical distortions.


Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone [URL]

Install Dependencies:

Python

Run the Calibration Script:

Navigate to the /src directory and run the calibration script with Python.

Usage

Use the provided scripts to calibrate your camera.

Follow the methodology outlined in the /docs directory for detailed instructions and theoretical background.

Test the calibration with your images and compare the results.

Acknowledgments

The project is based on the work and methodologies developed by Roger Y. Tsai.

Developed in collaboration with Jeffrey Simon.
