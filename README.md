# Camera-Callibration
Camera Calibration Using Tsai's Method
This repository contains the implementation of Tsai's method for camera calibration, demonstrated on a Logitech C270 webcam. The project aims to precisely map the 3D objects to their 2D image representations, addressing linear projection complexities and optical distortions.
